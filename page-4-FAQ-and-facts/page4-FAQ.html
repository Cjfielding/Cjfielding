			<h2>FAQ's</h2>

				<ol>
					<li>Are Jumping spiders dangerous/poisonous? (do they bite?)</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Although jumping spiders rarely bite, if they do you may experience mild pain/swelling. As they do produce venom it is used for prey and does not pose danger to humans.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
					<li>How long do jumping spiders live?</li>
						<ul>
							<li>They can live anywhere from 6 months to 3 years depending on species and sex. Males generally don’t live as long as females. </li>
						</ul>
						<br>
					<li>Can I keep multiple jumping spiders together?</li>
						<ul>
							<li>No, they will cannibalize each other. Mated pairs can be together for a short time, but the female may eat the male.</li>
							<li>If you want to have several spiders, keep them in separate terrariums and ensure they cannot get out or into each other's space.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
					<li>How can I bond with my jumping spider?</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Unfortunately, you can’t actually form a bond with a jumping spider as they’re not companion animals (and have not been bred to be, therefore lacking the same hardwiring dogs and cats do), but they can learn to recognize the elements about us as no threat to them and may become curious about you.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
					<li>Do jumping spiders need light in their enclosure?</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Yes, bright light is important for them and should be available about 12 hours a day. Use an automated daylight lamp for ease and consistency. </li>
						</ul>
						<br>
					<li>How far can a jumping spider jump?</li>
						<ul>
							<li>This is variable by species, some are only able to jump 2-3 times its body length while others - such as the Colonus puerperus- can get up to 38 times its own body length. </li>
						</ul>

					<li>The zebra jumping spider ( ) is one of the few insects that exhibit awareness of being observed by humans. Being seen to change behavior in front of and even look back at observers.</li>

						</ul>
						<br>
					<li>Like most other species of the Portia genus, these spiders are also immensely intelligent and remarkable for their hunting behavior, often implementing trial and error methods of catching their prey. Behavior which suggests that they are capable of learning and problem-solving, traits normally attributed to much larger animals. Piper</li>
